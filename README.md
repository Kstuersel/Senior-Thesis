# Horror Game Design Document

## A preview into an Ocean based horror game

### Core Design
This game should contain a few main elements to successfully scare the player, these include: 

    - Thalassophobia (Fear of large or deep water)
    - Claustrophobia (Fear of small spaces)
    - Xenophobia (Fear of the unknown)
    - Suspence of belief
    - Vulnerability

These 5 core components of the game should be used effectively to scare the user and create an 
atmosphere of dread, suspence, and fear of what may happen next.

### Story Concept
The story for this game should not be too complicated, as leaving the player open to interpreting
what could be happening can create a more intense feeling of vulnerability and lack of knowledge.

The story itself would be based inside a submarine that loses power and crashes to the bottom of
the ocean for an unknown reason. The player is forced to leave the Submarine to assess the damage
and try to fix what may be wrong. When returning inside, the player will find the rest of the crew
missing.

From here the player's goal is to survive and find a way back to the surface to get help or get back to shore.

### Gameplay
To keep the player from feeling like they have power in the situation they have been forced into,
the player must be slow and have limited options for defence. 

For example, swimming or walking quickly should be a risk and only viable when already being chased. Other gameplay elements could include:

    - A flashlight to stun the enemy
    - Distractions to move the enemy to a different location
    - puzzles or destinations that must be gone to that are dangerous
    - Hiding places for the player to get away from enemy

These gameplay intentions should keep the player engaged and on the edge of their seat

### Visual Design
The game will be set in a deep ocean arean, meaning the player shall be shrouded in darkness except for the 
lights of the submarine, the flashlight of the player, and the bioluminescence of any creatures in the ocean.

The submarine will be placed atop a crevas in the ocean bridging the two sides of it. The moonpool (A pressurized environment that allows a person to dive into the water from an interior environment) will be placed along this crevas and will be the only means in and out of the submarine.
