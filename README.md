# Thalassic Deep Game Design Document

## A preview into an Ocean based horror game

### A game design by: Kyle Stuersel

### Game Overview
Thalassic Deep is a Deep Sea horror game, using the innate fear of deep oceans and the unkown to scare the player as much as possible. The point is to instill dread and fear into a player as to be able to keep them on edge at all times.

The main places for this game are inside of the submarine and the immediate area outside the submarine. The inside of the submarine is generally a little rusty and desolate due to the rest of the crew being missing/kia. The outside of the submarine should not be a dark blue, but a black hue to the water to emphasize the depths the player is in. Not only this but some deep sea creatures should lurk around the environment, in which the submarine will be perched on top of a crevase that the player is forced to go into to repair the submarine.

### Story Concept
The story for this game should not be too complicated, as leaving the player open to interpreting
what could be happening can create a more intense feeling of vulnerability and lack of knowledge.

The story itself would be based inside a submarine that loses power and crashes to the bottom of
the ocean for an unknown reason. The player is forced to leave the Submarine to assess the damage
and try to fix what may be wrong. When returning inside, the player will find the rest of the crew
missing.

From here the player's goal is to survive and find a way back to the surface to get help or get back to shore.

### Core Design
This game should contain a few main elements to successfully scare the player, these include: 

    - Thalassophobia (Fear of large or deep water)
    - Claustrophobia (Fear of small spaces)
    - Xenophobia (Fear of the unknown)
    - Suspence of belief
    - Vulnerability

These 5 core components of the game should be used effectively to scare the user and create an 
atmosphere of dread, suspence, and fear of what may happen next.

### Gameplay
To keep the player from feeling like they have power in the situation they have been forced into, the player must be slow and have limited options for defence. 

For example, swimming or walking quickly should be a risk and only viable when already being chased. Other gameplay elements could include:

    - A flashlight to stun the enemy
    - Distractions to move the enemy to a different location
    - puzzles or destinations that must be gone to that are dangerous
    - Hiding places for the player to get away from enemy

These gameplay intentions should keep the player engaged and on the edge of their seat

An example loop of said gameplay:

1. player is trying to fix submarine which creates noise and attracts monster
2. player hears/sees monster coming inside submarine
3. player uses small object to create noise somewhere else by throwing it to distract monster.
4. player either sneaks by because the distraction worked or they run because the distraction faailed and they now must escape.
5. If player gets cornered they have the option to blind the enemy for a short moment with their flashlight, however the resource is limited and should be used sparingly.

### Visual Design
Note: References for this project can be found in the Reference images folder of this project.

The game will be set in a deep ocean arean, meaning the player shall be shrouded in darkness except for the 
lights of the submarine, the flashlight of the player, and the bioluminescence of any creatures in the ocean.

The submarine will be placed atop a crevas in the ocean bridging the two sides of it. The moonpool (A pressurized environment that allows a person to dive into the water from an interior environment) will be placed along this crevas and will be the only means in and out of the submarine.
